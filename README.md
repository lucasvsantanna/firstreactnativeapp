## This app allows you to add GitHub profiles in the main page. You are able to do that by putting the person's GitHub username and confirming on the add button. The app's main page shows some information about the added users, like profile image, username and bio.

### Once added the profile can be accessed by clicking on a "Ver perfil" button that is below the users' bios. Some informations are shown after you click on "Ver perfil". The profile image is shown, so as the username, the complete bio and the repositories the clicked user starred.
